# Summary

IT WORKS FOR MOBILE NOW !!!
(and some improvements were made)

# Improvements

- You cannot download the extracted palette if there's none
- Palette container orientation will follow your screen aspect ratio or orientation (vertical if in portrait, horizontal if in landscape)
- The 'no palette for now' text is now vertical when palette container is vertical
- The sidebar doesn't have borders anymore (it may come back in the future if it is unpleasing to see)

# Fixes

- Context menu now show properly on mobile, you can do it by pressing a menu button, pressing it again will cause the context menu to hide
